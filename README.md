# Bespin

[Bespin](http://bespin.io) is a library that contains reference implementations of "big data" algorithms in MapReduce and Spark. This repo contains datasets used in Bepsin demos:

+ The file `Shakespeare.txt` contains the [The Complete Works of William Shakespeare](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/100) from [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/).
+ The file `p2p-Gnutella08-adj.txt` contains a [snapshot of the Gnutella peer-to-peer file sharing network from August 2002](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/p2p-Gnutella08.html), where nodes represent hosts in the Gnutella network topology and edges represent connections between the Gnutella hosts. This dataset is available from the [Stanford Network Analysis Project](http://snap.stanford.edu/).
+ The tarball `taxi-data.tar.gz` contains a [one-day slice NY taxi data](http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml), chopped into one file per minute. See analyses in Todd Schneider's blog post [Analyzing 1.1 Billion NYC Taxi and Uber Trips, with a Vengeance](http://toddwschneider.com/posts/analyzing-1-1-billion-nyc-taxi-and-uber-trips-with-a-vengeance/).
